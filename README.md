Gives you a way to get a fancy league-like notification whenever you level up!

## Features:

- Set your desired notification title and text (and color)
- Select specific levels for the notification to trigger
  - A specific set of levels is set by default. Leave empty to display a notification for every level.
- Select specific skills for notifications to trigger
  - All skills are selected by default but if for some reason you want to only show levels for certain skills, it's there!
