## Features:

- Set your desired notification title and text (and color)
- Select specific levels for the notification to trigger
  - A specific set of levels is set by default. Leave empty to display a notification for every level.
- Select specific skills for notifications to trigger
  - All skills are selected by default but if for some reason you want to only show levels for certain skills, it's there!
- Multi-levels: leveling from level 1 to 20 at once will now trigger notifications for level 10 and 20 (if those are set in your levels list).
